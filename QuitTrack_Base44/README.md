QuitTrack — Daily Smoking Reduction Tracker

QuitTrack is a lightweight, user-friendly web app designed to help people gradually reduce their daily cigarette consumption through tracking, personalized goals, and structured reminder routines.

The project was fully built using Base44 (no-code/low-code platform), with a custom workflow for user onboarding, daily logging, goal progression, and behavioral insights. The app focuses on simplicity, clarity, and habit-building tools that encourage long-term reduction.

✨ Key Features
1. Personalized Onboarding

Users set:

Their current average daily cigarette consumption

A personalized reduction plan

Daily reminder times

Number of reminders per day

2. Daily Tracking

Users receive a simple daily check-in flow:

“How many cigarettes did you smoke today?”

Comparison to their daily target

Phase-by-phase reduction plan

3. Goal Progress Visualization

The app tracks:

Daily logs

Progress toward reduction

Changes in habits over time

4. Lightweight UX & Minimal Friction

Designed to make daily tracking effortless:

One-click daily logging

Clean and intuitive interface

Mobile-friendly layout

🔧 Integrations & Roadmap

The planned architecture includes:

Automatic reminder creation in Google Calendar

Email reminders at user-defined times

Scheduled automations for daily check-ins

However, Base44 currently requires a paid plan (Builder tier or higher) to enable Backend Functions and external integrations such as:

Google Calendar

Email automations

Scheduled backend jobs

⚠️ Since this project was built using the free tier, Calendar and Email integrations are not yet enabled.
These features may be added later if Base44 expands free-tier capabilities or if the project moves to a higher plan.
